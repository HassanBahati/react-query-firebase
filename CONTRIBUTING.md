- **Moving the PR to the backlog** - if the review requires non trivial effort and the issue isn't a priority; in this case the maintainer will:
  - Add the `backlog` label to the issue.
  - Leave a comment on the PR explaining that the review is not trivial and that the issue will be looked at according to priority order.
- **Starting a non trivial review** - if the review requires non trivial effort and the issue is a priority; in this case the maintainer will:
  - Add the "in review" label to the issue.
  - Self assign the PR.
